========== Below is Demikernel's Original README ==========

_Demikernel_ is a library operating system (libOS) architecture designed for
use with kernel-bypass I/O devices.  The _Demikernel_ architecture
offers a uniform system call API across kernel-bypass technologies
(e.g., RDMA, DPDK) and OS functionality (e.g., a user-level networking
stack for DPDK).

To read more about the motivation behind the _Demikernel_, check out

paper](http://irenezhang.net//papers/demikernel-hotos19.pdf).
